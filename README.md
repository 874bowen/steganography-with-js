# Hiding text in Images using Plain JavaScript

Steganography is the process of concealing information in an image or any otherdigital artifact. Steganography is used to conceal messags from someone you don't want to see it. With JavaScript we can easily use a tool to assist us in hiding/encoding data inside images and decoding/viewing the hidden message. Let's explore on how we can achieve this.

## Pre-requisites
To follow along through this article you are required to have: 
- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Knowledge in Javascript
- Some knowledge in Bootstrap

## Introduction
We will be using a JavaScript library by Peter Eigenschink [steganography.js](https://www.peter-eigenschink.at/projects/steganographyjs/) to build our project. This library offers great functions such as decode and encode text in images and abstracts the code behind these functions.


```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
